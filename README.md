2. Comprehensive Coverage of the Pipeline (5 points): score:  

   - 5 points: Includes all critical aspects of the pipeline, such as installation, setup, each component’s function, input/output details, and example runs. 

   - 3-4 points: Covers most aspects but misses some key components or lacks depth in explanation. 

   - 1-2 points: Provides minimal information; major gaps in coverage. 

   - 0 points: Fails to describe the key elements of the pipeline. 

3. Accuracy and Technical Detail (5 points): score:

4. Visuals and Examples (5 points): score: 

   - 5 points: Clear and relevant visuals (e.g., diagrams, flowcharts) and code examples that illustrate key points. Text is easy to read, with proper use of formatting (bold, italics, code blocks) to enhance understanding. 

   - 3-4 points: Some visuals or examples, but they are limited or not well-integrated into the explanation. Some formatting, but the presentation could be clearer or more consistent. 

   - 1-2 point: Very few visuals or examples; not helpful to the understanding of the pipeline. Some formatting, but the presentation could be clearer or more consistent.
